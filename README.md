# snoke-server

This repo contains the backend code for my game Snoke - a multiplayer web-clone of the classic Snake game.

Snoke can be played @ https://snoke.cloud

Please note currently there is only one server, which is hosted in Europe.

For more information about Snoke and its innerworkings, see the [Snokepedia](https://snoke.cloud/Snokepedia.pdf)

The foundation of this code is based on [multiplayerSnake](https://github.com/HungryTurtleCode/multiplayerSnake) - as taught in [Multiplayer Snake Game | JavaScript & Socket.io](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppcBIHv_ZPs)
